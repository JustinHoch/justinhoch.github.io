I decided to take a dive into GitHub Pages using Jekyll. My experience with it has so far been great. I was looking for a simple way to set up a blog and GitHub Pages with Jekyll is exactly what I needed.

## Setup
Setting up Jekyll on my local machine was pretty painless. The steps I took were mostly following [GitHubs Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) instructions for setting up Jekyll.

## Customization
As I was looking for a simple blog setup, I decided to go with a prebuilt theme. After browsing some of the themes I decided on [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk). It is a simple, clean, Jekyll theme that I liked the look of. It also had an added bonus of a dark mode toggler. After browsing the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and playing with my new Jekyll site I started to get the hang of how everything worked. After some color changes and some layout tweaks I was all set to go.

## Creating Blog Posts
I really like the way blog posts are created on Jekyll. Just create a markdown page with the date in front, for example: `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`, and put it in your `_posts` folder and your done. You can create posts right from GitHub or you can create them on your local machine and push the changes up to GitHub.

## Conclusion
So far I have really enjoyed using Jekyll with GitHub Pages. I plan on continuing to use this into the future as a place to post projects I am working and write some posts about the things I am learning on my Web Dev adventure.
